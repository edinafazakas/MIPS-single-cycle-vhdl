BIVB-1#1 Error
Bank IO standard Support  - IOBank:33
Bank 33 has incompatible IO(s) because: The LVCMOS33 I/O standard is not supported.  Move the following ports or change their properties:  
cat[3]
Related violations: <none>

BIVB-1#2 Error
Bank IO standard Support  - IOBank:34
Bank 34 has incompatible IO(s) because: The LVCMOS33 I/O standard is not supported.  Move the following ports or change their properties:  
an[3:0], cat[1], cat[4], cat[6], led[9] and led[10]
Related violations: <none>

BIVB-1#3 Error
Bank IO standard Support  - IOBank:34
Bank 34 has incompatible IO(s) because: The LVCMOS33 I/O standard is not supported.  Move the following ports or change their properties:  
clk
Related violations: <none>

BIVB-1#4 Error
Bank IO standard Support  - IOBank:34
Bank 34 has incompatible IO(s) because: The LVCMOS33 I/O standard is not supported.  Move the following ports or change their properties:  
sw[8] and sw[13]
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-12#1 Error
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets clk_IBUF] >

	clk_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to W5
	clk_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
29 out of 46 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: btn[0], sw[15], sw[14], sw[12], sw[10], sw[9], sw[7], sw[6], sw[5], sw[4], sw[3], sw[2], sw[1], sw[0], led[15] (the first 15 of 29 listed).
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
